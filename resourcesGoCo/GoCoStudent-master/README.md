# GoCoStudent
GoCo Student is an information hub for students at Gordon College. It allows
students to quickly check how many meal points or chapel credits you have
without having to navigate any Gordon websites.

Built with the Ionic Framework, AngularJS, and Cordova for iOS and Android.

## Version 1.0
The first version of the app only displayed a user's chapel credit.

## Version 2.0
The second version involved a technical overhaul of many components of the app
as well as the addition of meal points and interface animations.

## Version 2.1
The third version furthered the technical overhaul from version 2.0, including
the encapsulation of module behavior in an AngularJS directive and the ability
for the developer to easily add new modules to the app.

## Version 2.1.5
The fourth version was a minor update that fixed the banner (it was hidden behind
the main content after the removal of the ion-scroll element) and removed the
advertising (my AdMob account was suspended because all of the advertisement clicks
come from the single IP address of Gordon College).
